## What I find interesting about that article
What I found so interesting about this article is how transformative having AI is for our everyday life, not only directed towards work or academics. AI can be used in almsost every walk of life and is utilized in numerous career fields. However, there are many concerns about the preservation of human values. I found that this article stuck up a problem then went on to provide different solutions and how effective each of the solutions will be. For instance, one of the solution is to penalize malicious AI behavior and promote cybersecurity. Later on in the article goes on to add on stating, " AI must be governed by all the laws that already have been developed for human behavior, including regulations concerning “cyberbullying, stock manipulation or terrorist threats,” as well as “entrap[ping] people into committing crimes.” I find this particular quote interesting because we are already seeing the repercaution of having and using AI, such as people geing scam calls from supposed family memebers or individuals unknowingly engaging in fradulent activities.
